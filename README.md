# Alshwin - AI-Driven Bot for BDM Project Queries

Alshwin is a personalized AI-driven bot designed to assist with queries related to BDM (Business Data Management) projects. It leverages advanced language models and document retrieval techniques to provide accurate and relevant responses to user questions.

## Project Structure

- **app.py**: Main application file containing the Flask routes and chat logic.
- **database.py**: Handles database operations for storing and retrieving chat history.
- **read_documents.py**: Reads and processes PDF documents, and creates a vector store for document retrieval.
- **static/style.css**: Contains the CSS styles for the web interface.
- **templates/index.html**: HTML template for the chat interface.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists the Python dependencies required for the project.
