11,How to change the primary data analysis to secondary data analysis approach?,"A significant shift in approach! Changing from primary to secondary data analysis requires a thoughtful and systematic approach. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you transition:

1. **Re-evaluate your research question**: Since secondary data analysis focuses on existing data, revisit your research question to ensure it's feasible with secondary data. Adjust your question if necessary.
2. **Identify suitable secondary datasets**: Search for relevant datasets that align with your re-evaluated research question. Consider datasets from reputable sources, such as government agencies, academic institutions, or organizations.
3. **Assess data quality and limitations**: Carefully examine the secondary dataset's quality, coverage, and limitations. Be prepared to discuss these aspects in your analysis and interpretation.
4. **Choose an analysis approach**: Select an analysis approach suitable for secondary data, such as descriptive statistics, exploratory data analysis, or inferential statistics.
5. **Justify your data choice**: Provide a clear rationale for selecting the secondary dataset and analysis approach. Demonstrate how your choice aligns with your research question and objectives.
6. **Focus on pattern detection and explanation**: Secondary data analysis often involves identifying patterns, trends, and relationships in existing data. Emphasize these aspects in your analysis and interpretation.
7. **Originality and insights**: Strive to add new insights or perspectives to the existing literature by analyzing the secondary data through a unique lens or using innovative methods.
8. **Document your process and findings**: Thoroughly document your analysis process, including data cleaning, preprocessing, and statistical analysis. Present your findings clearly, highlighting trends, patterns, and insights.

By following these steps, you'll be well-prepared to transition from primary to secondary data analysis and produce a high-quality analysis.

24,how to do bdm project in iit madras,"Based on the provided context, here's a step-by-step guide on how to do a BDM (Business Development and Management) project in IIT Madras:

**Step 1: Repeat steps until you get your data**

* Repeat the process of collecting data until you get the required dataset
* If you find that you've invested too much time and still failed to get the data, consider switching to a project with primary data

**Step 2: Basic EDA and conversation with the business**

* Perform a basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the dataset to observe and get more detail into the problems
* Have another conversation with the business to confirm the identified problem statements

**Stage 2: Proposal**

* Follow the formatting guidelines:
	+ Font: Times New Roman, 12pt
	+ Spacing: 1.5
	+ Alignment: Justified
* Make sure to include the disclaimer ""it is IIT Madras BS program - academic project - The BDM Capstone Project"" in the proposal

32,"When I ask the business for data, they are reluctant to share. What need to be done in this situation?","According to the provided report and checklist, when a business is reluctant to share data for your project, you should:

1. Do not directly ask for data. They might find it like an attack on their business secrets.
2. Instead, use a ""Business 1st approach"". Understand their working and gaps in their business and try to identify problems through the conversation.
3. Always use a Polite and Professional tone.

Additionally, you should think on the problem, guess the potential dataset required to solve these problems, and then ask for the dataset. The approach should be on ""solving the problem"" through dataset analysis, not just asking for the dataset.
