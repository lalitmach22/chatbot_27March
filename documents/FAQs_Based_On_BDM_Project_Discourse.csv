1,I have doubt related to the data that we need to collect for the capstone project. What kind of data do we have to collect is it necessary to be a data from store (like ecommerce)?,"Hi,

You can collect it from the store. Anything that you wish to. 
Make sure you have watched the Capstone project video before proceeding towards data collection.

2,"Hi, so the company I have contacted has provided me the details of the books. It's a very small e-commerce company, that majorly sells books. Would it be fine if I just list the SKU's in the excel sheet instead of the actual name of the book/product? 
I also do not have inventory data, nor the cost price of the books.
They have provided the selling price, time of order, time of delivery, different channels of selling etc.
Would these conditions be fine?","Hi,

You cannot fudge the details when you present the project.

The data which you have is sufficient. However, you should be able to analyze it and come with some new insights that helps the decision maker.

3,"I have collected the data from a nearby Kirana store. What I could gather is the weekly profit, sales, stocks available, Purchase amount, and Selling Price of nearly 12-13 products.

Now with the available data, I have done weekly analysis based on sales and Profit but I am unable to figure out what else can I do. 

So, I just wanted to know what limit of analysis would suffice for the project. How many points for analyses should be present for the data?","Hi,

We need data for a months period. Analysis can have anything. Do use whatever has been covered in the class and try to replicate it. You will see some interesting patterns.

6,Do we need to give specific number for inventory (recommendation) or should we say that the shopkeeper needs to buy more? @Ashwin_J,"Hi,

You can suggest. But you also got to ask the owner why they haven't till now. It might be that there are high holding costs or could be that the shelf life is less or may be the demand is seasonal.

So before giving such recommendations you need to ask why didn't they do it in first place?

7,"@Ashwin_J Dear sir

In the live session it was mentioned that we can keep the name of the Company anonymous if we wish to. This is a sincere request, since I have got the data from a trusted person under the assurance that the name will be kept confidential. Though it is a one to one session, since the data I have collected is of a reasonably established business and sensitive information, confidentiality becomes of utmost importance.  In fact the data was shared without reservations (which is present in many cases) on the assurance that the name will not be disclosed. 
As for the authenticity of data, in my view, I have sufficient information about the business which can demonstrate the same. 
Kindly consider this request, that as long as the information is holistic, names need not be disclosed.

8,"Good evening
I think I read almost all posts on this topic and I want to clarify few doubts which I wasn't able to understand properly.

1) In the presentation are we supposed to write the whole story or information in the business in brief and data collection slide or just points would be enough?
2) In the word document write up part, apart from data collection, are we supposed to write the whole information about the insights, analysis and suggestions?
3) Due to lack of space in ppt, can I paste tables in the word document and only write the conclusions in the ppt ?
4) I can't fit the whole thought process in either ppt or word document. So during viva, Can I explain the things which are not written in the document ?

Thank you","Hi,

5 slides should have the all the things I have asked in the mail.

With regard to fitting it in 5 slides, it's an art. If you browse and do a check you will find a page write up that gives the entire picture of business.

Include only the ones you believe is important and justify the same as to why you think so.

9,"@ Ashwin Sir,

I have selected a partially structured manufacturing industry for my final project. This company is making cartoon box and paper core as a product. I am facing following problems during data collection and need your suggestion / guidance.
1. Only sales / purchase value against each invoice is available in soft.
2. All other value is manually kept, that means if i want to know what is the product is sold in a particular sales bill, i have to note its voucher number and manually search that voucher to find other details about that particular sale, same is true for purchase.
3. This company have huge variation of product. 

Under the above circumstances, i decided to select those product which contributes more than 80 % of the revenue, and collect all necessary data based on that. 
Am i doing the right thing? Kindly guide me, bcoz if the first step is not right then i may go to a complete wrong direction. 
Second thing, an u suggest some intelligent way to tackle this company, particularly the data collection part, how to go forward from this point.

Regards,

Samit Sen","Hi Samit,

You can do this as this falls under ""Decision Making Under Uncertainty""

When your viva happens, you can mention to the examiner, that you are presenting only the select data, due to unavailability. There is nothing right or wrong here, as you are analysing on the basis of the information you have at hand.

What you can actually do is, carry out some analysis and show to the people where you got the data from. If they are convinced, there is a chance they would give you more information.

Once week 7 and 8 gets over, you are likely to get more ideas as to how you got to proceed. For now, its a good start.

My specific doubt is on the topic: Data Collection

My doubt is: Do we have to collect data from local businesses around us or we can find it onIine.

I have already talked with two business owners about their businesses and asked for data but they didnt maintain any concrete data files which can be provided.

so I need clarification regarding where to collect data from.","Could you pls clarify what do you mean by online?

 Also, I have reached out to a person who owns a wholesale business in surgical items. We had a discussion but he can't think of any such business problem that he's facing. As it's a wholesale business, it's both business to business and, business to consumer. After so many requests he finally agreed to provide me with the data of some of his items like how much of items were purchased, sold, or were in stock in a month (as it's a wholesale business, I have asked for the data of 6-7 months as we were suggested in the lectures), but I don't know how to figure out the business problem. Like what should I do? @Ashwin_J","In that case, look at his data, do some analysis and you may uncover a problem.

I know the deadlines were communicated long ago and is very clear mentioned in all rubrics and live sessions but could we get an extension on the MIDTERM SUBMISSION given the HOLIDAY SEASON and vacations ?

Firstly There is a mention of No ""gantt chart and wbs"" in timeline.
Sir, there is no mention of these in our timeline and i just checked jan term guidelines and it is there.

Secondly, I was advised to add graphs in PSA(Problem solving Approach) part of proposal, again it was  not mentioned there so i did not add it. (Like in mid term it is written there specifically.)

I have approached a small business for my BDM project. I'll try to outline the problems as told to me by the director of the company. For context, I'm doing the BDM course and project both this term. 
The company has products and services for interiors and furniture for households, offices and educational institutions. They are targeting a small chunk of an existing sizeable market, and wish to continue at the same scale. 
Some of the problems that I can help with, according to them are:
1. Identify what product/service should be the focus area of their organisation.
2. Analyze the contribution of the workforce to the revenue.
3.  See if it's possible to leverage the skillset of their team to get a particular focus area for the organisation. 
They have about 5 years worth of data which I can get.

This is what I've got for now. I'm a little confused about the second requirement, how can I include it for my BDM project? Is it staying on topic for our project requirement? Kindly help me out with this.

Thanks,
Susmitha","Dear Susmitha,

This looks like an interesting project that you can embark upon.  

The second question pertains to value add per employee (read more about it). For instance, if there are two employees on the same role earning 10 lakhs per year and revenue one of the employee brings is about 100 lakhs per year, he is adding more value than another employee bringing 50 lakhs per year (all else remaining the same). 

This project certainly is a good opportunity to work; i strongly recommend you to take the project.  However, final decision lies with you

The final submissions should have detailed explanations of What, Why, When, Where and How phenomenon. These concepts tend not to be explained in mid term in much detail.

The requirements for Proof of originality is mentioned as below:

87,"I wish there was a consolidated and brief lecture series consolidating the deliverables of each of the  submission.  The rationale is that even though live sessions are a good source of knowledge. They are lengthy and large in number. My suggestion is to make  20 mins video for each of the submission titling

1. How to make a proposal?
2. How to make your mid-term submission?
3. How to do final submission?

A simple ppt and a lecture on these three topics will help the students on a lot of things. And they can join the live sessions if they have any specific doubts. The rationale to join all live session to gain even the basic fundae of the project is not sitting well with me because of the sheer volume of live sessions and not knowing the **agenda** of the live session.

 I am going to be completely honest, I have never attended any of the live session or watched  recordings of it and did all the submission based on the rubrics. I lost marks because I misinterpreted the rubrics which means that it is ambigous to me. 

Example:

> The results finding is not written properly. you are not supposed to write your plans here. its meant for the major finding in the descriptive section.

I didnt know that results and findings meant findings of descriptive stats

> A detailed explanation of the analysis process is not sufficient. Here, all methodologies must be included. From data gathering, cleaning, and sources to analysis Everything about data analysis must be summed up.

I didnt know that data gathering, cleaning and sources had to  be included in this since I already explained in mid term

and I shouldn't repeat my exec summary. How will my summary change for the project? 

I take full responsibility for my ignorance of live sessions but I will be really happy if you make the above suggested lecture series. There is always a  dynamic and stable component. Make lecture series for the stable component which is the deliverables for each of the session and for the dynamic component which is doubt have live sessions. 

My humble opinion and suggestions

Thank you

Edit: I would like to add that I really enjoyed the process and held it close to my heart. That's why I am a bit disaapointed that I lost marks because i couldn't find an easier source to clear my doubts. Weekly live videos are a very good source, but they shouldn't be the only source.","Dear @Sirius 

If you have not attended any live sessions as you mention, we cannot really help.

Rubrics + 6 documents+ reference books along with weekly live and masterclasses is the best we can do. A lot of time and efforts have been spent in preparing the documents.

As a sample I have given proposal document. You are expected to build on it for mid term and final. Don’t expect read to eat recipes 😉 This is a project and you need to put in efforts.

What I'm guessing this means (I'll take the mid-term evaluations as an example) is 

* Prior to the 13th (the resubmission date for mid-terms put on hold), reports will only be quickly glanced through to check if links work, requisite evidence is present, charts are present, etc, as well as the technical aspects coming under *major revision*

* The actual in depth evaluation of ***all*** reports, even the ones for which the above checks were met & which weren't put on hold, will only be done after the hold period i.e. the 13th.

Is this accurate or have I misunderstood something?

____________________","Reports with major revision will not be kept on hold. They r most likely to be rejected since it would require major modifications.

Hold decisions are first sent if the reports r minor meaning we skim it first to see if links (data, proofs etc) work and overall looks good at first glance. It is given only if links do not work. We do not evaluate the reports here and only skim. This is done for all reports.

If you haven’t received hold, it means your report is being evaluated and you will receive either an acceptance/ rejection post checks on the same.
